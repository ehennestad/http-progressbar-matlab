classdef ResumableFileConsumer < matlab.net.http.io.FileConsumer
%ResumableFileConsumer - Write a response body to a partial file that can be resumed
%   consumer = webprogress.internal.ResumableFileConsumer(PARTFILE,
%   STATEFILE, OFFSET, ETAG, TOTALBYTES) writes the body of a response to
%   PARTFILE. OFFSET is the start of the byte range that the request asked
%   for, or 0 for a request without a Range header. ETAG and TOTALBYTES
%   are the entity tag and length of the file the bytes in PARTFILE came
%   from, as saved in STATEFILE, or "" and NaN for a request without a
%   Range header. The file consumer appends the body to PARTFILE, and the
%   response status decides what happens first:
%       206 - The body is appended to PARTFILE when the response carries
%             the entity tag ETAG, its Content-Range starts at OFFSET and
%             gives TOTALBYTES or an unknown length, and the body has no
%             content coding. A different entity tag, start or length
%             raises the error webprogress:download:RestartRequired,
%             which ends the transfer before the body is received, so
%             that the caller can download the file from the beginning.
%       200 - PARTFILE is replaced by the body, and STATEFILE is written
%             with the entity tag and length of the new response, or
%             deleted when the response has no strong entity tag.
%   A body with a content coding raises an error for either status. A
%   response with any other status leaves both files unchanged, and its
%   body goes to the response message as without a consumer.
%
%   After the response, ExpectedBytes is the size PARTFILE has when the
%   whole body arrived, and TotalBytes is the length of the complete
%   file. Each is NaN when the response does not give it.
%
%   STATEFILE holds the strong entity tag of the file and its total
%   length. It never holds the URL, which for a presigned URL carries a
%   signature.
%
%   This class is used by webprogress.download.
