function declaredBytes = getDeclaredLength(response)
%getDeclaredLength - Return the length that Content-Length announces for a body
%   N = webprogress.internal.getDeclaredLength(RESPONSE) returns the value
%   of the Content-Length header field of RESPONSE, or NaN when the
%   response has no such field, as a chunked response does not.
%
%   A response with several Content-Length fields of different values is
%   invalid (RFC 9110, section 8.6), and the length of its body cannot be
%   known, so it is an error. Repeated fields with the same value count as
%   one.
%
%   This function is used by webprogress.download.
