function savedFilePath = download(targetPath, url, options)
%download - Download a file from the web and display progress
%   webprogress.download(FILENAME,URL) downloads the file at URL and
%   saves it to FILENAME exactly, without adding an extension, and
%   replaces an existing file. Progress is shown in a waitbar.
%   Percent-encoded characters in URL, such as %20, are sent unchanged.
%
%   If FILENAME is a folder, the file is saved in that folder under the
%   name the server gives in its Content-Disposition header, or else
%   under the last segment of the URL path.
%
%   The file is received in a temporary file in the target folder, which
%   replaces the target only after a successful download. If the
%   download fails or is interrupted, an existing file is left unchanged.
%
%   FILEPATH = webprogress.download(FILENAME,URL) also returns the full
%   path of the saved file.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,DisplayMode=MODE) specifies where
%   progress is shown. MODE must be:
%       "Dialog Box"     - (default) Shows progress in a dialog box.
%       "Command Window" - Prints progress in the Command Window.
%       "None"           - Shows nothing. Use it with ProgressFcn to show
%                          progress in a display of your own.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,UpdateInterval=SECONDS) specifies
%   the minimum number of seconds between progress updates. The default
%   is 1.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,ShowFilename=SHOW) shows the file
%   name from URL in the progress title when SHOW is true. The default
%   is false.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,Filename=NAME) shows NAME in the
%   progress title, whether SHOW is true or false. Use it when the last
%   segment of URL is not the name to show, for example an identifier.
%   The default is '', which leaves the title to ShowFilename.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,IndentSize=N) indents progress
%   printed in the Command Window by N spaces. The default is 0.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,Figure=FIG) shows progress in a
%   uiprogressdlg in the figure FIG. Before R2025a, FIG must be a
%   uifigure. For other figures, progress is shown in a waitbar.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,FileSizeBytes=N) specifies the file
%   size in bytes to use for progress when the server does not report it.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,ProgressFcn=FCN) calls FCN with the
%   progress of the download, at most once per UpdateInterval and once
%   more when it is done. FCN receives a struct with the fields
%   ActionName ("Download"), TransferredBytes and TotalBytes. Both byte
%   counts include the part of a resumed download already received.
%   TotalBytes is NaN when the size is unknown.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,CancelRequestedFcn=FCN) calls FCN
%   before the download and at most once per UpdateInterval while it
%   runs. When FCN returns true, the download stops and
%   webprogress.download raises the error webprogress:download:Cancelled.
%   No file is saved, but with Resume=true the part received so far is
%   kept, so a later call can continue from it. The Cancel button of the
%   progress dialog stops the download in the same way.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,Resume=TF) keeps the part of the file
%   received so far when the download fails or is interrupted, and
%   continues from it on a later call when TF is true. The default is
%   false. FILENAME must be a file path, not a folder. The part is kept
%   in FILENAME + ".part", and the ETag and length of the file it belongs
%   to in FILENAME + ".part.json". A later call with Resume=true asks the
%   server for the rest of that file only, so URL may differ between
%   calls, as a presigned URL does. If the file has changed on the
%   server, or the server cannot send part of a file, the download starts
%   from the beginning. The same happens when the server gives the file
%   no ETag or a weak one. Both files are deleted after a successful
%   download. Two MATLAB sessions that download to the same FILENAME
%   with Resume=true write the same partial file and corrupt it.
%
%   webprogress.download raises an error if the server responds with a
%   status that is not a successful 2xx status, if the connection closes
%   before the number of bytes the server announced in its
%   Content-Length header has arrived, or if the server announces
%   different lengths in several Content-Length headers. In each case no
%   file is saved. With Resume=true, the part received before the error
%   is kept.
%
%   Example: Download a file and print progress in the Command Window
%       url = "https://allen-brain-observatory.s3.us-west-2" + ...
%           ".amazonaws.com/visual-coding-2p/stimulus_mappings.json";
%       filePath = webprogress.download(tempdir, url, ...
