function savedFilePath = download(targetPath, url, options)
%download - Download a file from the web and display progress
%   webprogress.download(FILENAME,URL) downloads the file at URL and
%   saves it to FILENAME exactly, without adding an extension, and
%   replaces an existing file. Progress is shown in a waitbar.
%   Percent-encoded characters in URL, such as %20, are sent unchanged.
%
%   If FILENAME is a folder, the file is saved in that folder under the
%   name the server gives in its Content-Disposition header, or else
%   under the last segment of the URL path.
%
%   The file is received in a temporary file in the target folder, which
%   replaces the target only after a successful download. If the
%   download fails or is interrupted, an existing file is left unchanged.
%
%   FILEPATH = webprogress.download(FILENAME,URL) also returns the full
%   path of the saved file.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,DisplayMode=MODE) specifies where
%   progress is shown. MODE must be:
%       "Dialog Box"     - (default) Shows progress in a dialog box.
%       "Command Window" - Prints progress in the Command Window.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,UpdateInterval=SECONDS) specifies
%   the minimum number of seconds between progress updates. The default
%   is 1.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,ShowFilename=SHOW) shows the file
%   name from URL in the progress title when SHOW is true. The default
%   is false.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,Filename=NAME) shows NAME in the
%   progress title, whether SHOW is true or false. Use it when the last
%   segment of URL is not the name to show, for example an identifier.
%   The default is '', which leaves the title to ShowFilename.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,IndentSize=N) indents progress
%   printed in the Command Window by N spaces. The default is 0.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,Figure=FIG) shows progress in a
%   uiprogressdlg in the figure FIG. Before R2025a, FIG must be a
%   uifigure. For other figures, progress is shown in a waitbar.
%
%   [...] = webprogress.download(...,FileSizeBytes=N) specifies the file
%   size in bytes to use for progress when the server does not report it.
%
%   webprogress.download raises an error if the server responds with a
%   status that is not a successful 2xx status, if the connection closes
%   before the number of bytes the server announced in its
%   Content-Length header has arrived, or if the server announces
%   different lengths in several Content-Length headers. In each case no
%   file is saved.
%
%   Example: Download a file and print progress in the Command Window
%       url = "https://allen-brain-observatory.s3.us-west-2" + ...
%           ".amazonaws.com/visual-coding-2p/stimulus_mappings.json";
%       filePath = webprogress.download(tempdir, url, ...
%           "DisplayMode", "Command Window");

    %   Content-Encoding such as gzip is decoded while it is saved, so its
