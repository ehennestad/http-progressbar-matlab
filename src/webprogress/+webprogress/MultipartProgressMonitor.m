classdef (Sealed) MultipartProgressMonitor < webprogress.FileTransferProgressMonitor
%MultipartProgressMonitor - One progress display for a file sent in several parts
%   monitor = webprogress.MultipartProgressMonitor(TOTALBYTES) creates a
%   progress monitor for a file of TOTALBYTES bytes that is uploaded in
%   several requests, one part per request. Pass it to each upload with
%   webprogress.upload(...,ProgressMonitor=monitor). The display stays
%   open between the requests and shows the progress of the whole file.
%   An upload that succeeds adds its part to CompletedBytes, so a part
%   that fails and is sent again is counted once.
%
%   monitor = webprogress.MultipartProgressMonitor(TOTALBYTES,Name=Value)
%   sets display options:
%       DisplayMode    - "Dialog Box" (default), "Command Window" or
%                        "None".
%       UpdateInterval - Minimum number of seconds between updates. The
%                        default is 1.
%       Filename       - Name shown in the progress title. The default
%                        is "".
%       IndentSize     - Number of spaces before progress printed in the
%                        Command Window. The default is 0.
%       Figure         - Figure for a uiprogressdlg. The default is [].
%       ProgressFcn    - Function called with the progress of the whole
%                        file. See webprogress.FileTransferProgressMonitor.
%       CancelRequestedFcn - Function that returns true when the upload
%                        should stop. It acts as the Cancel button does.
%       CompletedBytes - Bytes of the file that the server accepted in
%                        earlier calls, as after a cancel. The default
%                        is 0. Progress counts them, and the remaining
%                        time is estimated from the parts this monitor
%                        sends.
%
%   Call close(monitor) after the last part to close the dialog or to
%   print the completion message. Deleting the monitor also closes the
%   dialog. If the user presses Cancel, or CancelRequestedFcn returns
%   true, IsCancelled becomes true and webprogress.upload raises the
%   error webprogress:upload:Cancelled for the part in progress and for
%   each later part, which it does not send. To continue after a cancel,
%   create a new monitor with CompletedBytes set to the bytes the server
%   accepted, and send the remaining parts.
%
%   Example: Upload a file in parts of 100 MB
%       fileInfo = dir(filePath);
%       partSize = 100 * 2^20;
%       monitor = webprogress.MultipartProgressMonitor(fileInfo.bytes, ...
%           "DisplayMode", "Command Window");
%       for offset = 0:partSize:fileInfo.bytes-1
%           numBytes = min(partSize, fileInfo.bytes - offset);
%           partUrl = getPartUrl(offset); % URL from the storage service
%           webprogress.upload(filePath, partUrl, "Offset", offset, ...
%               "NumBytes", numBytes, "ProgressMonitor", monitor);
%       end
%       close(monitor)
